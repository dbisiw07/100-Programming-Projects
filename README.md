## Beginners

### Project: **Restaurant Bill Calculator with a Tip**

#### Programming skills Needed

- Data Types
- String Manipulations

### Description:

Make a simple App to Calculate a restaurant bill. Lets say you go to a restuarant with your friends. You enjoyed your meal and the service was so nice you decided to give additional money on top of your bill, ie you decide to give a Tip. Example, if your bill is 7 Ghana and you decide to give a tip of 1 Ghana, you pay them 8 Ghana :).
Write a program to calculate how much each person in your group will pay considering the tip and the bill.

### Requirements:

#### Inputs:

- Number of Friends
- Amount of bill
- Tip Percentage <br>

#### Output:

- Amount per person in the group <br>

### Example Run:

Wecome To Bill Calculator <br>
What was the total bill ? : GHC 124.54 <br>
How many people to split the bill? 5 <br>
What percentage tip will you like to give, 10, 12, or 15 ? 12 <br>
Each person will pay : 27.9

## Algorithms and Data Structures

1. Given an integral number N. The task is to find the count of digits present in this number. <br>
  `Example: When N = 2019, Number of digits in N here is 4 and, the digits are: 2, 0, 1, 9`
2. For a given number N check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.
  `For N = 5, output Yes and output No for N= 4`
3. Given a temperature in celsius C. You need to convert the given temperature to Fahrenheit.
4. Given an integer N. Find the number of digits that appear in its factorial.Factorial is defined as, factorial(n) = 1*2*3*4……..*N and factorial(0) = 1.
5. You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 ` Example 1:Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb" Output: 3` <br>
  ` Example 2:Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ" Output: 0 `
