        Make a simple App to Calculate a restaurant bill. Lets say you go to a restuarant with your friends. You enjoyed your meal and the service was so nice you decided to give additional money on top of your bill, ie you decide to give a Tip. Example, if your bill is 7 Ghana and you decide to give a tip of 1 Ghana, you pay them 8 Ghana :).
        Write a program to calculate how much each person in your group will pay considering the tip and the bill.
